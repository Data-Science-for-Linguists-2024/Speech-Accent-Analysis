## About the Data
The *full* dataset used for this project is the George Mason University Speech Accent Data, that is readily available on [accent.gmu.edu](accent.gmu.edu). However, the website's search/query feature is currently down so we cannot access the audio samples by bulk. Luckily, however, there is a Kaggle dataset, which is a subset of the full thing that already contains 2000+ audio samples that we utilized to avoid scraping all the entries which would take forever.

The data directly does not intentionally have the full dataset, for logistical reasons, instead it contains samples which is a very small version of the full dataset to demonstrate the structure of the data in this project.
